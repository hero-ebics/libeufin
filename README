Installing LibEuFin
===================

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=$PFX
$ make install # Note: This may require Java=18; Java=17 had errors, Java>=19 is unsupported by gradle

If the previous step succeeded, libeufin-nexus and a command line
client (libeufin-cli) should be found under $PFX/bin.  Additionally,
the libeufin-sandbox command used for testing should be found under
$PFX/bin as well.

Launching LibEuFin
==================

Launch Nexus:

$ libeufin-nexus serve --with-db=jdbc:postgres://localhost:5433?user=foo&password=bar

More instructions about configuring and setting Libeufin
are available at this link:

https://docs.taler.net/libeufin/nexus-tutorial.html

Exporting a dist-file
=====================

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure # prefix not relevant for dist.
$ make dist

The Zip file should be contained into the build/distributions/ folder.
